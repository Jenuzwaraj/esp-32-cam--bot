
1. Motor Specifications
Voltage Rating: 12V
Current Rating: 500mA (0.5A) per motor
2. Total Current Requirement
Given that two L298N motor drivers are used in parallel, each controlling a pair of motors, the total current requirement can be calculated as follows:

[ \text{Total Current} = 2 \times 0.5A = 1A ]

3. L298N Specifications
Voltage Range: 5V to 35V
Current Rating: Up to 2A per channel
Total Current Capacity: Each L298N can handle 2A per channel, allowing for a maximum of 4A across two channels.
4. Power Supply Requirements
To ensure reliable operation, the power supply must meet the voltage and current requirements of the motors:

Voltage Requirement: Must match the motor voltage (12V).
Current Requirement: Should exceed the total current requirement. A safety margin is typically included:
[ \text{Recommended Current} = \text{Total Current} + \text{Safety Margin} ]

Assuming a safety margin of 20%:

[ \text{Recommended Current} = 1A + (0.2 \times 1A) = 1.2A ]

Thus, a power supply rated at 12V, 2A or higher is advisable.

5. Voltage Drop Consideration
The L298N motor driver has a voltage drop of approximately 2V. Therefore, the effective voltage supplied to the motors will be:

[ \text{Effective Voltage} = 12V - 2V = 10V ]

This voltage drop may affect the performance of the motors, particularly under load conditions.

6. Heat Dissipation
The L298N motor driver can generate heat during operation, especially when driving motors at higher currents. It is essential to implement proper heat sinking to prevent thermal shutdown and ensure reliable performance.
